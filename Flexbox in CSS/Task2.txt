Role of Following key properties in the Flexbox layout model:-

1. Justify-content: In the Flexbox layout model, justify-content is a CSS property that controls the alignment of items along the main axis of a flex container. The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. By default, in a horizontal flex container, the main axis is horizontal, and in a vertical flex container, it is vertical.

2. align-items:In the Flexbox layout model, the align-items property is used to control how flex items are aligned along the cross-axis of their container. The cross-axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis, which is determined by the flex-direction property (either horizontal or vertical).

3. gap: In the Flexbox layout model, the gap property is not a standard property or part of the Flexbox specification. However, there is a property in CSS Grid Layout called gap that is commonly used for creating gaps (spacing) between grid items in a grid container. The CSS Grid Layout and the Flexbox layout are two different layout models, and they serve different purposes.


4. flex-direction:In the Flexbox layout model, the flex-direction property is used to define the direction in which flex items are laid out within a flex container. It determines whether the flex items are arranged horizontally or vertically, and it also influences the order in which they appear.
The flex-direction property can take one of four values:"row","row-reverse","column","column-reverse"

5. flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property is part of the Flexbox layout model in CSS and is used to control how flex items are laid out within a flex container when they don't have enough space to fit in a single row or column. It determines whether flex items should wrap to a new line or column when the available space is insufficient to accommodate them all.
The flex-wrap property can take one of three values: "nowrap","wrap","wrap-reverse"
